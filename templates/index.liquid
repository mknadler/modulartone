		<p>This project illustrates the connection between the scales commonly used in art and design and the musical intervals which inspire those scales.</p>
		<p>The ratio of the widths of the <span id="horizontal-description">left part of this site and the right part of this site</span><span id="vertical-description">top part of this site and the bottom part of this site</span> is the same as the ratio between the two notes which comprise the selected interval.</p>
		<p>Confused? Consider, for example, an octave. The A note above middle C has a frequency of 440hz; the next A note above that has a frequency of 880hz. The ratio of these frequencies, and of every octave interval, is 1:2. If you play an octave, the proportions of this site will also be 1:2.</p>
